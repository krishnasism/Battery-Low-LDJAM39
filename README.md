# Battery-Low-LDJAM39
Hello everyone. This is the source code for my game made during the Ludum Dare Jam 39. 
The game is made by me only. Couldn't submit it to the compo because I lost one day due to college.

This is my first Ludum Dare Jam(also my first Game Jam in general).
The source is pretty simple and straightforward to use. You don't need any external dependencies.
I have removed just the .keystore file from the source. 

While playing this game, please make sure that you have found the right orientation, where
your phone and the in-game phone's rotations are the same. Else, you will have problems.
For me facing south seems to have accurate gameplay.

Thank you.
Have fun!
